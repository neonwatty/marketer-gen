# **App Concept: AI-Driven Content Generation for Marketers**

### **Core Purpose**

A platform that helps marketers **automatically generate a campaign plan and content** without needing to define every detail themselves. The system provides **step-by-step guidance**, **brand-aware customization**, and **ongoing performance insights**, allowing marketers to go from goals, to strategy, to execution, to optimization—all in one streamlined experience.

---

## **Key Capabilities**

### **1\. Guided Customer Journey Builder**

* Marketers define their **customer journey** by first identifying campaign purpose , and then automatically suggesting appropriate journey steps through stages like Awareness, Consideration, Conversion, and Retention (etc).

* The app suggests effective content types, messaging, and channel strategies for each stage.

* Users can jump-start campaigns using **pre-built journey templates** tailored to their goals or industries.

* Support for **multiple journeys per brand or persona**.

---

### **2\. Brand Identity & Messaging Integration**

* Marketers can upload:

  * Brand guidelines

  * Compliance documents

  * Messaging playbooks

  * Creative assets (PDFs, slides, images)

  * External links to campaigns or inspirational content

* These materials are processed by the system to ensure that generated content adheres to voice, tone, restrictions, and brand rules.

* Users can define **messaging frameworks** (e.g., brand pillars, tone ladders, product positioning).

---

### **3\. Automated Content Generation**

* The system creates tailored content for each journey stage and channel, including:

  * Social media posts

  * Ads

  * Email sequences

  * Landing page copy

  * Video scripts (future roadmap)

* Users can revise, regenerate, or approve content.

* Options for **format variants** (e.g., short-form vs. long-form, promotional vs. educational).

---

### **4\. Campaign Summary Plan (Before Generation)**

* After journey and brand inputs are completed, a summary plan is generated showing:

  * What content will be created

  * Where it will appear

  * Why these decisions were made

* This gives users clarity before content is produced and supports stakeholder alignment.

---

### **5\. Performance Monitoring & Optimization**

* Optional tracking via integrations with:

  * Consumer-grade tools (Meta, Google Ads, YouTube, LinkedIn)

  * Enterprise platforms (Sprinklr, Marketo, Salesforce, HubSpot)

* Users can view metrics like:

  * Impressions

  * Click-through rates

  * Engagement

  * Conversions

* AI suggestions drive continuous improvement.

* Includes **version tracking**, A/B testing insights, and content retirement planning.

---

### **6\. Team Collaboration & Approval Workflows**

* Ability to share content drafts or collaborate throughout the process with multiple other users

* Assign review roles or set approval checkpoints

* Export decks, messaging one-pagers, or calendars for wider teams

# **Updated User Flows**

## **User Flow 1: Quick Start with a Journey Template**

**(LLM-Enhanced, Agency-Inspired)**

User Flow 1: Quick Start with a Journey Template

(LLM-Enhanced, Agency-Inspired)

Goal:

Help marketers quickly and confidently launch a demand generation campaign using a proven journey structure — with the intelligence, polish, and flexibility of a modern creative agency.

1\. User signs in or creates an account

Standard authentication to begin.

2\. User selects a campaign journey template

* User first selects a campaign type or purpose: Product Launch, Lead Gen Funnel, Re-Engagement, etc.  
  * Once the user selects the campaign type or purpose, the app will auto-generate customer journey stages (e.g., Awareness → Consideration → Conversion) based on the campaign type selected and KPIs.  
  * The app should use the following journeys for each given campaign type:  
    * Product Launch: TBD  
    * Customer Acquisition: TBD  
    * Lifecycle Campaign: TBD  
    * Lead Gen Funnel: TBD  
    * Re- Engagement: TBD  
    * Other? TBD

3\. LLM-guided campaign intake

* App conducts a brief conversational intake about the purpose of the campaign (who we are trying to reach, to what end, with what offer/product):  
  * Business goal (e.g., “Increase demo signups”)  
  * Product or offer focus  
  * Timing or constraints  
  * Audience  
* Using inputs, validates user has selected correct campaign type/customer journey, or suggests alternative if the user has not selected the correct option

4\. LLM-guided campaign intake: brand identity definition

* User selects or uploads:  
  * Brand guidelines, tone/voice docs, messaging principles  
  * Compliance rules and legal restrictions  
* LLM enforces brand tone, voice, and compliance constraints  
* If the user does not have any supporting documentation or information for brand identity, they can either choose to skip this step, or the LLM should help them develop the missing information

5\. LLM-guided campaign intake: market & competitive input 

The app should ask the user, “Would you like to include competitor or market context?”

Option A: Upload

* User provides competitive decks, screenshots, documents, or notes  
* LLM summarizes positioning, messaging trends, whitespace

Option B: Guided Research

* LLM reviews information provided to determine if the user has already provided sufficient context  
* LLM asks for key competitors if known, if not, conducts research  
* Suggests differentiation and campaign angles  
* Generates a competitive snapshot to inform strategy.

Option C: Skip

6\. LLM-guided campaign intake: budget context 

* User may enter:  
  * Total or paid media budget  
  * Or opt for “no budget — focus on organic”  
  * or opt for “budget unknown, suggest a budget based on prior campaign performance and desired outcomes”. In this case, user can provide previous budgets and success metrics.  
  * LLM tailors channel mix, content depth, and reuse strategies.  
  * If desired, the user can skip this step

7\. LLM-guided campaign intake: compliance & constraints

* User can upload:  
  * Legal documents  
  * “Do not say” lists  
  * Other compliance guidelines  
* LLM screens all generated content accordingly.  
* User can skip this step

8\. Campaign plan generation (Strategist-style)

* Based on all prior inputs, app proposes:  
  * A structured customer journey and an appropriate stage-based campaign  
  * Channel and asset mix  
  * Funnel alignment  
  * Strategic rationale in plain language  
  * A creative approach or theme that will be threaded through all assets created in the next step  
* The app should illustrate all customer journeys in the style found here: [https://jerosoler.github.io/Drawflow/](https://jerosoler.github.io/Drawflow/)  
* It should also allow the user to revise the customer journey through this mechanism   
* User approves or tweaks before proceeding  
* User should have the option to share with stakeholders for review and feedback at this stage

9\. Content creation (Journey-aligned)

* For each stage, the app creates:  
  * Emails, social posts, ads, landing pages (etc) based on recommended channel and asset mix  
  * Assets are created in known size/ratios for selected channels, or user should be able to edit requirements for assets  
  * LLM-powered revision tools (e.g., “Make it punchier”)

10\. A/B testing workflow

* The user can optionally choose to enable an AB testing workflow, or they can skip. If they choose, they can:  
* “Generate A/B Variant” for any content (email, ad, subject line)  
* Variants tagged (e.g., urgency vs. benefit-led)  
* User defines test goal (CTR, open rate, etc.)  
* Post-test feedback loop informs future content  
* LLM shares best practices: “test one variable at a time”

11\. Persona tailoring

* User can duplicate and adapt all content or select a subset of content to be duplicated and adapted for additional personas (e.g., IT vs. Finance)  
* LLM adjusts tone, language, channel emphasis.  
* User can skip this step if desired, or choose to address additional personas through a net new process

12\. Stakeholder-ready outputs

* One-click export of:  
  * Campaign summary deck  
  * Messaging one-pager  
  * Channel rollout plan  
  * Sample content preview, presentation-style

13\. Launch or export

* User can:  
  * Publish to tools (CMS, email, social, or platforms like Marketo and Sprinklr)  
  * Download assets  
  * Schedule rollout

14\. Post-launch iteration

* User can optionally choose to:  
  * Upload performance data or feedback  
  * LLM recommends changes (e.g., retargeting, revised copy)
