# Test Coverage Report for Marketer Gen

## Summary
- **Current Line Coverage**: 30.23% (276/913 lines)
- **Total Test Files**: 30
- **Total Tests Run**: 98 (from models, services, and policies)

## Coverage by Component

### Models (✅ Good Coverage)
- User model: Well tested with 17 tests covering authentication, roles, profile management, suspension, and locking
- Session model: 12 tests covering session management and security
- AdminAuditLog model: 9 tests covering audit trail functionality
- Activity model: 17 tests covering activity tracking and suspicious behavior detection
- PasswordResetToken: Basic tests included

### Services (✅ Good Coverage)
- SuspiciousActivityDetector: 12 comprehensive tests covering all detection patterns

### Policies (✅ Good Coverage)
- ApplicationPolicy: Basic tests
- UserPolicy: Tests for authorization rules
- RailsAdminPolicy: 3 tests covering admin access control

### Controllers (❌ Poor Coverage)
Most controller tests are failing due to asset pipeline issues in the test environment:
- HomeController
- SessionsController
- RegistrationsController
- PasswordsController
- ProfilesController
- UsersController
- UserSessionsController
- ActivitiesController

### Integration Tests (❌ Poor Coverage)
- AdminWorkflowTest: 6 tests, mostly failing due to asset issues
- ActivityTrackingTest: Multiple tests with 2 failures

## Key Issues

1. **Asset Pipeline in Tests**: The main blocker for achieving higher coverage is the asset pipeline configuration issue causing most controller and integration tests to fail with:
   ```
   ActionView::Template::Error: Asset `application.js` was not declared to be precompiled in production.
   ```

2. **Missing Test Areas**:
   - Rails Admin custom actions (suspend/unsuspend)
   - Admin dashboard functionality
   - Email notifications (password reset, etc.)
   - File upload functionality (avatar)
   - Complex user workflows

## Recommendations for Improving Coverage

1. **Fix Asset Pipeline Issue**: 
   - Configure test environment to handle asset compilation properly
   - Or stub/mock asset-related calls in tests

2. **Add Missing Controller Tests**:
   - Test all controller actions with proper authentication
   - Test authorization for different user roles
   - Test error handling and edge cases

3. **Add Integration Tests**:
   - Full user registration and login flow
   - Password reset workflow
   - Profile update with avatar upload
   - Admin workflows (user management, suspension, audit logs)
   - Activity tracking across different actions

4. **Add Mailer Tests**:
   - Password reset email
   - Account suspension notification
   - Security alert emails

5. **Add Helper Tests**:
   - Rails Admin dashboard helper
   - Any view helpers

## Current Test Statistics
- Models: 67 tests, 195 assertions ✅
- Services: 12 tests, 42 assertions ✅
- Policies: 19 tests, 80 assertions ✅
- Controllers: ~70 tests (mostly failing)
- Integration: ~30 tests (mostly failing)

## Target Coverage
For a production application, aim for:
- Overall coverage: 80%+
- Model coverage: 90%+
- Controller coverage: 80%+
- Service/Policy coverage: 90%+
