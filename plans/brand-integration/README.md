## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: File Upload System (TDD)
**Agent**: test-runner-fixer → ruby-rails-expert
**Duration**: 2-3 days
**Tests First**: Write comprehensive failing test suite
- Configure Active Storage for multiple file types (PDF, DOCX, images)
- Build secure upload interface with progress tracking
- Support external links and references
- Handle file validation and virus scanning
**Quality Gates**: All tests green, file uploads work for all supported formats

### Phase 2: AI Processing Pipeline 
**Agent**: ruby-rails-expert
**Duration**: 3-4 days
**Tasks**: Implement to make tests pass
- Enhance BrandAnalysisService for document processing
- Extract brand voice, tone, and personality characteristics
- Identify restrictions, compliance rules, and preferences
- Build automated rule validation system
**Quality Gates**: Brand extraction accuracy >95%, rule validation working

### Phase 3: Messaging Framework Tools
**Agent**: ruby-rails-expert
**Duration**: 2-3 days
- Create messaging playbook editor with rich text support
- Build brand rule validation engine with real-time feedback
- Implement compliance checking system with scoring
- Add brand consistency scoring and recommendations
**Quality Gates**: All messaging tools functional, compliance checking accurate

### Phase 4: Code Quality & Linting
**Agent**: ruby-rails-expert (RuboCop)
**Duration**: 1 day
- Run RuboCop linting on all new Ruby code
- Fix style violations and code quality issues
- Ensure consistent Ruby coding standards
**Quality Gates**: Zero RuboCop violations

### Phase 5: UI Integration
**Agent**: tailwind-css-expert
**Duration**: 2-3 days
- Design brand management dashboard
- Create brand asset library interface
- Build compliance validation UI with visual indicators
- Implement responsive design for mobile access
**Quality Gates**: UI matches design system, fully responsive

### Phase 6: Real-time Features
**Agent**: javascript-package-expert
**Duration**: 2-3 days
- Implement real-time brand rule checking
- Add live compliance scoring
- Create interactive brand guideline viewer
- Build drag-and-drop file upload
**Quality Gates**: Real-time features working, good performance

### Phase 7: JavaScript Quality
**Agent**: javascript-package-expert (ESLint)
**Duration**: 1 day
- Run ESLint on all TypeScript/JavaScript code
- Fix linting violations and style issues
- Ensure consistent JavaScript coding standards
**Quality Gates**: Zero ESLint violations

## Test-Driven Development Strategy
- **TDD Cycle**: Red → Green → Refactor → Lint
- **Coverage Target**: Minimum 85% for new code
- **Test Types**:
  - Unit tests for services and models
  - Integration tests for file upload flow
  - System tests for end-to-end brand compliance
  - Performance tests for large file processing

## Technology Stack Considerations
- **Backend**: Rails 8 with Active Storage for file handling
- **AI Integration**: Leverage existing LLM service infrastructure
- **File Processing**: PDF parsing, DOCX text extraction
- **Frontend**: React components for interactive features
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS following existing design system

## Integration Points with Existing Code
- **Journey Builder**: Integrate brand compliance into journey step validation
- **Content Generation**: Hook into existing LLM content creation pipeline
- **User Management**: Leverage existing authentication and permissions
- **Analytics**: Track brand compliance scores and improvements

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies
1. **High Risk**: AI extraction accuracy
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing with real brand guidelines, fallback to manual entry
2. **Medium Risk**: Large file processing performance
   - Mitigation: Background job processing, file size limits, progress indicators
3. **Medium Risk**: Brand rule complexity
   - Mitigation: Gradual rollout, flexible rule engine, user feedback system
4. **Low Risk**: UI/UX complexity
   - Mitigation: Iterative design, user testing, progressive enhancement

## Complexity Analysis
- **File Upload System**: Medium complexity (existing Active Storage patterns)
- **AI Processing**: High complexity (custom LLM integration, document parsing)
- **Rule Engine**: High complexity (flexible validation system)
- **UI Components**: Medium complexity (standard React/Tailwind patterns)

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: Existing user authentication, LLM service infrastructure
- **External**: OpenAI/Anthropic APIs, PDF parsing libraries
- **Data**: None (new feature, creates its own data)
