## Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies
1. **High Risk**: Real-time collaboration conflicts and data consistency
   - Mitigation: Operational transformation, conflict resolution algorithms, data validation
2. **Medium Risk**: External API changes breaking integrations
   - Mitigation: API versioning, comprehensive testing, fallback mechanisms
3. **Medium Risk**: Export format compatibility across platforms
   - Mitigation: Multiple format support, validation testing, user feedback
4. **Medium Risk**: Performance with many concurrent collaborators
   - Mitigation: Efficient WebSocket management, connection pooling, load balancing
5. **Low Risk**: Approval workflow complexity
   - Mitigation: Template workflows, visual builder, user training

## Complexity Analysis
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Very High complexity (WebSocket management, conflict resolution)
- **Approval Workflows**: High complexity (state management, conditional logic)
- **Export System**: Medium complexity (format conversion, file handling)
- **CMS Integrations**: Medium complexity (API authentication, data mapping)
- **Social Media Publishing**: Medium complexity (platform APIs, scheduling)
- **UI Components**: Medium complexity (real-time updates, interactive elements)

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: User authentication, content management, campaign system
- **External**: Platform APIs (WordPress, Mailchimp, Facebook, etc.)
- **Infrastructure**: WebSocket support, background job processing

## Performance Targets
- **Real-time Updates**: <500ms for collaboration actions
- **Export Generation**: <30 seconds for standard formats
- **Platform Publishing**: <2 minutes for social media posts
- **Concurrent Users**: Support 50+ simultaneous collaborators
- **API Response Time**: <3 seconds for external platform operations

## Integration Priority Order
1. **WordPress & Email Marketing** (most common integrations)
2. **Facebook/Instagram Publishing** (high demand social platforms)
3. **Real-time Collaboration** (core team productivity feature)
4. **Approval Workflows** (enterprise requirement)
