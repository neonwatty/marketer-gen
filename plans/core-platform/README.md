- **Brand System**: Ensure all content follows brand guidelines
- **Journey Builder**: Campaigns can be built from journey templates
- **Analytics**: Track campaign performance and content effectiveness
- **User Management**: Role-based access to campaigns and content

## Risk Assessment and Mitigation Strategies
1. **High Risk**: Statistical accuracy in A/B testing
   - Mitigation: Use established statistical libraries, peer review calculations
2. **Medium Risk**: Performance with large content repositories
   - Mitigation: Elasticsearch indexing, pagination, lazy loading
3. **Medium Risk**: Collaboration conflicts in content editing
   - Mitigation: Real-time conflict detection, merge resolution tools
4. **Medium Risk**: Complex approval workflow configurations
   - Mitigation: Template-based workflows, visual workflow builder
5. **Low Risk**: Export format compatibility
   - Mitigation: Multiple format support, format validation testing

## Complexity Analysis
- **Campaign Planning**: Medium complexity (template system, LLM integration)
- **Content Management**: High complexity (version control, collaboration, search)
- **A/B Testing**: High complexity (statistical analysis, real-time tracking)
- **UI Components**: Medium complexity (responsive design, real-time updates)
- **Integration**: Medium complexity (multiple system integration points)

## Dependencies
- **Internal**: LLM Integration (Task 4), Brand Integration (Task 3)
- **External**: Statistical analysis libraries, export generation tools
- **Infrastructure**: Elasticsearch, Redis for real-time features

## Performance Targets
- **Campaign Generation**: <5 seconds for standard campaigns
- **Content Search**: <1 second for queries across large repositories
- **A/B Test Analysis**: Real-time updates with <2 second latency
