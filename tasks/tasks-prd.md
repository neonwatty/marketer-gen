### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they test (e.g., `app/models/model.rb` and `test/models/model_test.rb`)
- Use `rails test [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests
- Integration tests should be placed in `test/integration/` directory
- System tests should be placed in `test/system/` directory
