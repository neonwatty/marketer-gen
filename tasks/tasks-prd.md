### Notes

- Unit tests should be placed alongside code files using `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts` extensions
- Use `npm test` to run all unit tests, `npm run test:coverage` for coverage reports
- Integration tests for database operations use `npm run test:prisma`
- E2E tests use `npm run test:e2e` with Playwright
- API routes should include proper error handling and input validation
- All LLM integrations should implement streaming responses and fallback mechanisms
