# Temporary Playwright Tests Summary

## Overview
This document outlines the temporary Playwright E2E tests created to verify the recent Next.js code changes and new campaign components functionality.

## Generated Test Files

### 1. Campaign Components Tests (`campaign-components.spec.ts`)
**Purpose**: Test the newly added campaign dashboard components
**Coverage**:
- **CampaignCard Component**:
  - Renders with all required elements (title, description, status badge)
  - Displays campaign metrics correctly (engagement, conversion, content pieces)
  - Shows progress bar with correct percentage
  - Handles dropdown menu interactions (View, Edit, Duplicate, Archive)
  - Displays additional metrics when available (total reach, active users)
  - Shows last updated date in correct format

- **CampaignGrid Component**:
  - Renders responsive grid layout with multiple cards
  - Shows loading state with skeleton cards
  - Displays empty state when no campaigns exist
  - Maintains responsive behavior across screen sizes

- **CampaignCardSkeleton Component**:
  - Renders skeleton loader with proper shimmer animation
  - Shows correct count of skeleton cards in grid

- **Integration Tests**:
  - Campaign data loading and display
  - User interactions and hover effects

- **Development vs Production**:
  - Consistent behavior across build modes
  - Hot reloading compatibility

- **SEO and Meta Impact**:
  - Page SEO preservation
  - Open Graph image handling

- **Error Handling**:
  - Image loading error graceful handling
  - Invalid props error prevention

## Test Data Requirements

### Mock Data Needed
1. **Campaign Data Structure**:
   ```typescript
   interface Campaign {
     id: string
     title: string
     description: string
     status: 'active' | 'draft' | 'paused' | 'completed' | 'archived'
     metrics: {
       engagementRate: number
       conversionRate: number
       contentPieces: number
       totalReach?: number
       activeUsers?: number
     }
     progress: number
     createdAt: Date
     updatedAt: Date
   }
   ```

2. **Test Selectors Required**:
   - `[data-testid="campaign-card"]`
   - `[data-testid="campaign-grid"]`
   - `[data-testid="campaign-card-skeleton"]`
   - `[data-testid="status-badge"]`
   - `[data-testid="more-options-button"]`
   - `[data-testid="campaign-dropdown-menu"]`
   - Various metric and content selectors

## Running the Tests

### Prerequisites
1. Ensure Playwright is installed and configured
2. Make sure the Next.js application is running
3. Database should be accessible for auth tests

### Commands

#### Run All Temporary Tests
```bash
npx playwright test tests/temp/
```

#### Run Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Campaign components
npx playwright test tests/temp/campaign-components.spec.ts

# Auth error handling
npx playwright test tests/temp/auth-error-handling.spec.ts

# Dashboard exports
npx playwright test tests/temp/dashboard-exports.spec.ts

# Priority prop changes
npx playwright test tests/temp/priority-prop-changes.spec.ts
```

#### Run with Different Browsers
```bash

npx playwright test tests/temp/
```

## Test Maintenance

### Moving Tests to Permanent Suite
Once the temporary tests are validated:

1. **Review test results** and identify stable, valuable tests
2. **Move successful tests** to permanent test directories:
   - `tests/e2e/campaign-components.spec.ts`
   - `tests/integration/auth-error-handling.spec.ts`
   - `tests/unit/dashboard-exports.spec.ts`
   - `tests/performance/priority-prop-changes.spec.ts`

3. **Update test data** and selectors as needed for permanent implementation
4. **Integrate with CI/CD** pipeline for continuous testing

### Cleanup Instructions
```bash
# Remove temporary test directory when no longer needed
rm -rf tests/temp/
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Mock Data Dependencies**: Some tests require specific mock data that may not exist yet
2. **Selector Dependencies**: Tests assume specific `data-testid` attributes that need to be added to components
3. **API Dependencies**: Auth tests may require specific API endpoints to be available
4. **Database Dependencies**: Some auth tests require database connectivity

## Next Steps

1. **Add Required Test IDs**: Update components with necessary `data-testid` attributes
2. **Implement Mock APIs**: Create mock API endpoints for testing scenarios
3. **Validate Test Coverage**: Run tests and adjust based on actual implementation
4. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline performance metrics
5. **Integration with CI**: Add tests to continuous integration pipeline

## Test Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
# For auth testing
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=test-secret
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

# For database testing  
DATABASE_URL=test-database-url
```

### Test Configuration
The tests are designed to work with the existing `playwright.config.ts` configuration. Ensure the following settings:

- Base URL pointing to your development/test server
- Appropriate timeouts for component loading
- Browser configurations for cross-browser testing
- Test output directory for reports and screenshots

This comprehensive test suite provides thorough coverage of the recent changes and ensures the stability and functionality of the new campaign components and authentication improvements.
