			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Rails 8 Application with Required Technology Stack",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Rails 8 initialization into: 1) Run rails new command with proper flags for Vite and Tailwind, 2) Configure Vite for optimal asset processing with Rails, 3) Set up Stimulus controllers and verify JavaScript framework integration, 4) Create initial marketing-specific directory structure and test the full stack",
			"reasoning": "This is a straightforward Rails initialization task with well-documented commands. The complexity is low since it's mostly running standard Rails generators and configuration. The greenfield nature makes this simpler as there's no existing code to migrate or conflict with."

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Design and Implement Core Database Schema",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) Design ERD and schema documentation, 2) Create Campaign model with migrations and validations, 3) Implement CustomerJourney model with stage management, 4) Build BrandIdentity model and associations, 5) Create ContentAsset model with polymorphic associations, 6) Implement Template model and journey templates, 7) Set up model associations and foreign keys, 8) Write comprehensive model tests and seed data",
			"reasoning": "Database design requires careful planning of relationships and polymorphic associations. The complexity comes from designing a flexible schema that supports various content types and relationships while maintaining data integrity. Multiple interconnected models increase complexity."

			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build File Upload System for Brand Materials",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: 1) Configure Active Storage with cloud storage provider, 2) Create BrandAsset model with file validations, 3) Build drag-and-drop upload UI with Stimulus, 4) Implement PDF text extraction service, 5) Add virus scanning integration, 6) Create file management interface with preview capabilities",
			"reasoning": "Active Storage setup is straightforward, but adding PDF processing, virus scanning, and drag-and-drop UI increases complexity. Security considerations and file processing add technical challenges beyond basic uploads."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Campaign Journey Builder Interface",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,

		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Build Content Management and Generation System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: 1) Create ContentGenerator service architecture, 2) Implement channel-specific content generators, 3) Build content versioning system, 4) Create approval workflow engine, 5) Develop content preview and editing UI, 6) Implement A/B variant generation, 7) Build content formatting services, 8) Create export functionality for multiple formats, 9) Add content scheduling and calendar views",
			"reasoning": "Managing multiple content types across channels with versioning and workflows is complex. The system needs to handle various formats, approval states, and export options while maintaining consistency and quality."
