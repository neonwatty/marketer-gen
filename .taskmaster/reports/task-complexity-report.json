			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Next.js Project with TypeScript and Essential Dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Next.js initialization into: 1) Run create-next-app with TypeScript and App Router configuration, 2) Install and configure Tailwind CSS with custom theme settings, 3) Set up shadcn/ui with initial component installation (Button, Card, Input, Dialog), 4) Create base folder structure (components/, lib/, types/, utils/) with TypeScript configuration",
			"reasoning": "This is a greenfield project with no existing code. Task involves standard tooling setup with well-documented procedures. Complexity is low as it's mostly running CLI commands and initial configuration. The project is completely empty, requiring basic initialization steps."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Configure Database Schema with Prisma ORM",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide schema creation into: 1) Install Prisma and configure SQLite database connection, 2) Design and implement User, Brand, and Campaign models with relationships, 3) Create Journey, Content, and Template models with proper associations, 4) Implement Analytics model and set up tracking relationships, 5) Run initial migration and create seed data for testing",
			"reasoning": "Requires careful schema design with multiple interconnected models. Complex relationships between Campaign, Journey, Content, and Brand entities need proper foreign keys and constraints. No existing database structure means full design from scratch with consideration for future scalability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core UI Components and Layout System",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure component development as: 1) Create main layout shell with responsive navigation header and sidebar, 2) Build form components (FormWrapper, form field variations) with validation, 3) Implement file upload component with drag-and-drop and preview, 4) Create data display components (ContentCard, ProgressBar), 5) Build navigation components (StepperNavigation, Tabs), 6) Set up consistent theming with CSS variables and typography system",
			"reasoning": "Requires building multiple reusable components with TypeScript interfaces. Must ensure consistency across component library while integrating shadcn/ui. Moderate complexity due to need for responsive design, accessibility, and proper component composition patterns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Build Campaign Dashboard and Management Interface",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize dashboard development into: 1) Create main dashboard layout with routing and navigation, 2) Build campaign overview cards with status indicators and metrics display, 3) Implement campaign listing with shadcn/ui DataTable including filters and search, 4) Create campaign creation wizard with multi-step form validation, 5) Build detailed campaign view with journey visualization component, 6) Implement campaign CRUD operations with Prisma integration, 7) Add optimistic UI updates and loading states throughout",
			"reasoning": "Complex feature requiring multiple interconnected views, data management with Prisma, sophisticated UI interactions including wizards and data tables. Needs proper state management, error handling, and performance optimization for dashboard with potentially many campaigns."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Guided Customer Journey Builder",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down journey builder into: 1) Set up React DnD or @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop foundation, 2) Create journey canvas component with stage rendering and connections, 3) Build journey templates system with template selection UI, 4) Implement stage configuration panels with form inputs for each stage type, 5) Create journey validation logic and error handling, 6) Build journey persistence with Prisma integration, 7) Implement journey export/import functionality, 8) Add AI suggestion placeholders with mock data structure",
			"reasoning": "Most complex UI feature requiring sophisticated drag-and-drop interactions, visual journey representation, template system, and complex state management. Needs careful architecture for stage relationships, validation logic, and smooth user experience with potentially complex journey configurations."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Create Brand Asset Management System",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Structure brand system as: 1) Implement file upload with drag-and-drop using react-dropzone or similar, 2) Create brand profile management interface with sectioned forms, 3) Build asset storage system with file organization and metadata, 4) Implement asset preview with thumbnail generation for different file types, 5) Create asset library UI with search, filtering, and tagging, 6) Add version control system for brand assets with history tracking",
			"reasoning": "Moderate to high complexity due to file handling, preview generation for multiple formats, and need for organized asset management. Requires careful consideration of file storage strategy, metadata management, and efficient retrieval mechanisms."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Content Generation Interface and Management",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Divide content system into: 1) Build content generation form with type selection and configuration, 2) Integrate TipTap or similar rich text editor with toolbar customization, 3) Implement version history system with diff visualization, 4) Create approval workflow with state machine for review stages, 5) Build content preview components for different channels, 6) Implement bulk generation interface for journey stages, 7) Set up placeholder LLM API structure with mock responses",
			"reasoning": "Complex feature combining rich text editing, version control, workflow management, and multi-channel preview. Requires sophisticated state management for approval workflows, efficient diff algorithms for version comparison, and flexible architecture for future LLM integration."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Build Campaign Summary and Planning Interface",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Organize summary interface as: 1) Create campaign overview dashboard with key metrics and journey visualization, 2) Build timeline/calendar view using a library like FullCalendar or custom component, 3) Implement budget allocation interface with calculations, 4) Create presentation mode with fullscreen views and export options, 5) Build campaign comparison tools with side-by-side views, 6) Implement campaign cloning and template creation functionality",
			"reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving data aggregation, visualization, and multiple view modes. Requires careful data structure design for efficient summary generation and comparison features. Calendar integration and export functionality add technical complexity."
