# Task ID: 1
# Title: User Authentication & Account Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Design and implement the core user authentication and account management system for the AI-driven content generation platform using Ruby on Rails 8.
# Details:
This should include user registration, login, profile management, and role-based access control for different user types (marketers, team members, administrators). The system should leverage Rails 8's built-in authentication generator, which provides secure authentication out of the box without external gems. Documentation: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html, https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html#session, https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/authentication.html

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for authentication flows using RSpec, integration tests for user management, security testing for access controls, and user acceptance testing for the complete registration/login experience.

# Subtasks:
