Instead of configuring vite.config.js, we'll work with the esbuild configuration that Rails 8 generates by default. This involves modifying the esbuild settings in package.json scripts or creating a dedicated esbuild configuration file. We need to set up proper entry points for app/javascript/application.js and app/assets/stylesheets/application.tailwind.css.
